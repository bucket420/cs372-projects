I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this program.

1. What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
	The hardest part was linking the road segments with the same name so that I could print the GPS instructions. I looped through all the nodes and keep track of the total distance, but that was not very clean.
2. Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute them by name.
	I didn't receive any help.
3. Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
	I didn't encounter any serious problems.
4. Did you do any of the challenges (see below)? If so, explain what you did.
	No.
5. List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
	None.
